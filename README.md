# CLIMB Token - Rebuilt

Fixed bug on contract and making improvements to the token and miner solutions.

## Token

The token is a self LP token similar to what xUSD is doing. BUYS and SELLS consistently bring the price up due to the 5% fee taken on each operation.

## Miner

The miner was bugged with an exploit, found and corrected.
Will still optimize it

# Frontend

Due to changes in the IT team, the frontend code is in needd of rebuilding from the ground up which allows for improvements such as using wagmi and wallet connect web3 modal.
